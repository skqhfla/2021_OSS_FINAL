## Site Documentation

#### The website is intended for college students. 
#### We have credits to take for graduation. 
#### Instead of directly calculating this, just entering information will calculate your credit.

## Using Programs

#### You can enter your name, school year, semester, department, and email address.
#### The remaining credits are printed from the graduation credits minus the credits you have taken so far.

#### If you enter and save the class name, grade, and grade for each class, the total credit will be calculated. 
#### In addition, pressing "Add" adds the column, and pressing "Delete" deletes the column.
